What is React?
ReactJS, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces,makes the development of UI components easy and modular.

The key features of React are:

Component-based architecture: A Component is the smallest unit in a React application. Anything that you want to render on the browser can be rendered through components. Components help in maintainability and re-usability.
Virtual DOM: React uses virtual DOM concept for DOM manipulation which improves the performance of the application
Unidirectional data flow:  React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast and easy for debugging.
JSX syntax: React used JSX syntax which is similar to XML and HTML syntax which makes it easy for writing markup and binding events in components 
SEO performance: The SEO performance can be improved using the server-side rendering concept. We can develop isomorphic applications using React which increases the SEO performance.
